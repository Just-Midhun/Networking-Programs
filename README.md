# Networking-Programs
Set of programs available for networking concept visualization.

## List of available programs include:
+ TCP Client-Server Programs: <br>
TCP-based client-server programs enable reliable, bi-directional communication between a client and server. Clients initiate connections to servers, and data is exchanged through established connections, ensuring data integrity and sequencing.

+ UDP Client-Server Programs: <br>
UDP-based client-server programs allow fast, connectionless data transfer between a client and server. UDP datagrams are sent without establishing a connection, making it ideal for real-time applications but lacking TCP's reliability features.

+ Distance Vector Routing: <br>
Distance Vector Routing is a dynamic routing algorithm used in networks to determine the best path for data transmission. Routers exchange routing tables, calculating distances (metrics) to destinations, and update routes based on the shortest paths.

+ Sliding Window Protocol: <br>
Sliding Window Protocol is a flow control technique used in data communication. It allows the sender to transmit multiple data packets without waiting for individual acknowledgments, optimizing data throughput.

+ File Transfer Using TCP: <br>
File transfer using TCP involves reliable transmission of files between a client and server. TCP's connection-oriented nature ensures data integrity and guarantees that the complete file is delivered successfully.

+ Leaky Bucket (QoS): <br>
The Leaky Bucket is a Quality of Service (QoS) mechanism that regulates network traffic. It smoothens the data flow by controlling the rate at which packets are transmitted, preventing network congestion and maintaining stable delivery.
